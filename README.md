### "Welcome to the realm of code sorcery, where bugs fear to tread and algorithms dance in binary ballet." -semicit
Hi there, i'm Alessandro, a Software Engineer Student in La Sapienza of RomeðŸ‘‹

I am thrilled to create special things with my hands, my code is like poetry:
1)elegant;
2)efficient;
3)occasionally misunderstood by compilers. :)
