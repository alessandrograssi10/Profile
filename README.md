# Code Sorcery Realm 🧙‍♂️

Welcome to the realm of code sorcery, where bugs fear to tread and algorithms dance in binary ballet. ✨

## About Me 👋

Hey, I'm Alessandro, a Software Engineering student at La Sapienza in Rome! 🎓

## Code Poetry 📜

I'm passionate about creating special things with my hands – my code is like poetry:

1) Elegant
2) Efficient
3) Occasionally misunderstood by compilers. 🤖😄
